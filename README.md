### Crop Recommendation system

## GOAL

A rule-based system use rules to suggest crops based on weather patterns, and other relevant factors


## DESCRIPTION

<br>I will use Machine learning algorithm like logistic regression and randomforest to predict which crop would by relevent to grow in that condition and environment
<br>In this logistic regression model is used to predict crop recommendation system while random forest is used to check quality of soil 


## MODELS USED

In this project I have used Logistic regression and random forest model. Because it is very efficient for classification problems

## LIBRARIES NEEDED

<br>streamlit
<br>seaborn
<br>pandas
<br>matplotlib.pyplot
<br>numpy
<br>ML algorithms
<br>sklearn

## ACCURACIES

<br>Accuracies and results of Algorithms used
<br>The accuracy score achieved using  Logistic Regression in crop recommendation is: 95.45 %
<br>The accuracy score achieved using Random Forest in soil fertility prediction is: 100 %

## CONCLUSION

This type of system is relatively simple to implement and may be suitable for smaller farms with less complex data needs.
A crop recommendation system can be a valuable tool for farmers, helping to increase crop yield, optimize resource use, and reduce the risk of crop failure due to environmental factors.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run the given snippet in terminal.

```bash
  streamlit run main.py
```
